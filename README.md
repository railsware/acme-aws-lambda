# this two lines fix problem with require gems in AWS lambda
load_paths = Dir["./vendor/bundle/ruby/2.5.0/bundler/gems/**/lib"]
$LOAD_PATH.unshift(*load_paths)
# require gem
require 'acme_aws_lambda'

AcmeAwsLambda.configure do |config|
  config.production_mode = true
  config.contact_email = 'admin@example.com'
  config.domains = ['example.com', '*.example.com']
  config.common_name = '*.example.com'
  config.s3_bucket = 'example.com-certificates'
  config.s3_certificates_key = 'certificates/example.com'
  config.route53_domain = 'example.com'
end

def handler(event:, context:)
